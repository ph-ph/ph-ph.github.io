<p>I plan to use this blog as a random collection of reports about my side projects and things that I learned or looked into along the way.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted publicly on the Internet for like 10 years (not counting twice-a-year-on-average posts on Facebook and Instagram). I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had to, really. But more recently I came to the conclusion that having a blog of sorts might be useful for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m fairly convinced that writing down what I learned in a somewhat formal and public way is a very important part of learning, at least for myself. I&rsquo;ve forgotten most of the things that I ever learned, and I think this is in big part because I&rsquo;ve rarely made an effort to &ldquo;crystallize&rdquo; all that knowledge in some way. Writing a blog that nobody reads is not the best way to approach this (teaching a class on the subject to real people is definitely better), but it&rsquo;s something. I&rsquo;ll see if it helps.</p>
<p>Second, I really don&rsquo;t like posting things publicly, mostly for wrong reasons, like avoiding being wrong or misunderstood in public. Making myself write non-trivial stuff that (theoretically) everyone on the Internet can see might be a good way to shift my default attitude here.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the ability to explain complex things in writing is an important and somewhat underappreciated skill for engineers. Having regular practice for this skill won&rsquo;t hurt, I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably post a lot of inaccurate or plain wrong stuff here. I rarely go deep in my learning and explorations - I&rsquo;m more interested in building high-level mental models of how things work and I&rsquo;m often too lazy to verify the details. If you see something that is clearly wrong, or if you strongly disagree with something, please message me <a href=https://twitter.com/dkishylau>on Twitter</a> or reach out in some other way.</p>
